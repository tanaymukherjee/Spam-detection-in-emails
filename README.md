# Spam-detection-in-emails
In this exercise I will build a spam classifier program in python which can tell whether a given message is spam or not.

Email spam, also known as junk email, is unsolicited bulk messages sent through email. The use of spam has been growing in popularity since the early 1990s and is a problem faced by most email users. Recipients of spam often have had their email addresses obtained by spambots, which are automated programs that crawl the internet looking for email addresses. Spammers use spambots to create email distribution lists. A spammer typically sends an email to millions of email addresses, with the expectation that only a small number will respond or interact with the message.

In Machine Learning, there are many ways to detect spam such: decision-based systems, Bayesian classifiers, support vector machine, neural networks and sample-based methods.

In this exercise, I will build a spam classifier program in python which can tell whether a given message is spam or not. We can do this by using a simple, yet powerful theorem from probability theory called Bayes' Theorem.
